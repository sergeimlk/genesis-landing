Hyper-realistic, ultra-detailed close-up portrait showing only the left half of my face submerged in water, one eye in sharp focus, positioned on the left side of the frame. The water is crystal clear with tiny air bubbles clinging to the skin and eyelashes. Soft, natural light filtering through the water.
